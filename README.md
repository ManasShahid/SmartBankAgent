**Multi-Layer Autonomous AI Agents for Banking Workflows**

AgenticBankAI is a cutting-edge simulation of **Agentic AI in banking applications**, demonstrating how multi-layer autonomous agents can handle customer queries, loan processing, transaction monitoring, and more using **MCP memory, RAG retrieval, and A2A agent handoff**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project showcases the following Agentic AI concepts applied to banking:

- **Autonomous Agents:** Agents capable of independent decision-making.
- **Multi-Layer Architecture:** Perception → Planning → Execution → QA.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** Structured memory for context-aware operations.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Integrates external knowledge sources.
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Portal:** Agents communicate and handoff data seamlessly.
- **Simulated Banking APIs:** For account balance, loan application, and transaction history.

This setup demonstrates a realistic workflow similar to production banking AI systems.

## 🏦 Banking Use Cases

1. **Customer Support:** Answer account-related queries automatically.
2. **Loan Processing:** Evaluate loan eligibility and simulate approvals.
3. **Transaction Monitoring:** Fetch and summarize recent transactions.
4. **Compliance & QA:** Validate agent outputs and ensure simulated banking rules are followed.

**Workflow:**
1. **QueryAgent:** Understands customer input and intent.
2. **PlannerAgent:** Determines next steps (balance check, loan application, transaction retrieval).
3. **ResponseAgent:** Calls banking APIs or uses RAG to generate answers.
4. **QAAgent:** Monitors responses for correctness and updates workflow status.
5. **A2A Handoff:** Agents pass context & memory automatically.

## ⚡ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgenticBankAI.git
cd AgenticBankAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.10+
* `langgraph`
* `langchain`
* `openai`
* `faiss-cpu`

---

## 🛠 Usage

```python
from agentic_bank_ai import run_workflow

# Example customer query
customer_query = "Can I check my account balance and apply for a loan?"
run_workflow(customer_query)
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Customer Query: Can I check my account balance and apply for a loan?
Response Agent Output: Your account balance is $5,000.50. Loan approved for $10,000, credit score: 720
QA Status: passed
```
